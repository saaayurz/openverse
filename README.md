# OpenVerse 🌐

OpenVerse is an open, evolving web platform built to document learning, experimentation, and real-world web development — one commit at a time.

This repository is designed to grow gradually from a simple frontend website into a scalable, well-documented web application.

## 🚀 Vision

The goal of OpenVerse is not to rush features, but to:
- Learn by building in public
- Follow professional engineering practices
- Create a single long-term project instead of many disconnected mini-projects
